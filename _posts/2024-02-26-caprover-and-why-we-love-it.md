# CapRover and why we love it
Some links may be affiliate links that keep this site running.


Hello selfhosters! Today we write about one of our favorite tools: CapRover. It's not just that we like it; we love it! CapRover which positions itself as a PaaS (Platform as a Service), has been slowly creeping into the hearts of developers, and we are here to tell you why. If you've been on the lookout for a solution that simplifies the complex process of app deployment, CapRover may be just what you need.via GIPHY

I host majority of my cloud instances on HostHatch VPS (Virtual Private Server) Instance (In Asia) for a steal. Some of the other hosts I use are RackNerd (US) and WebHorizon (Asia+Europe) VPS, and decided that it is time to move away from Linode - which is a Great service, but I am looking to reduce the billing on instances. For comparison, I save more than %50 on HostHatch compared to Linode ($3.33 compared to $8) - Don't get me wrong, if this was an extremely critical application, I would keep it on Linode.

## Easy to Use

We love CapRover because it's so darn easy to use! Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newbie just getting your feet wet, you'll find that CapRover's user-friendly interface and straightforward instructions are a breeze to navigate. It eliminates the complexities usually associated with deploying applications, allowing you to focus more on developing your app and less on the headache of deploying it.

## Open Source and Self-Hosted

Open-source software has the advantage of a community of developers constantly working to improve it, and CapRover is no exception. Being open-source means that it's free to use and modify, which makes it a fantastic tool for developers on a budget. Moreover, because it's self-hosted, you have full control over your data. This means you can tweak your environment to your heart's content and have peace of mind knowing exactly where your data is.

## Wide Range of App Support

Whether you're working with NodeJS, Python, Ruby, PHP, or Docker, CapRover has got you covered. It can handle a wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool for any project you might be working on. This flexibility reduces the need to switch between different platforms for different projects, streamlining your workflow and increasing productivity.

## One-Click Apps

Let's not forget one of CapRover's most useful feature – the one-click apps. These pre-configured apps can be deployed instantly, saving you the time and effort of setting up everything from scratch. Want to set up WordPress? Click. Need a MongoDB database? Click. It's as simple as that! We even went ahead and set up our own custom repository where we publish apps for Caprover, you can find it on our Github page.

## Templating

The one click apps also bring us to the variety of templates you can deploy with Caprover in creating your applications, you can also use a GitHub repo to deploy your developed applications.

## Scalability

Another reason why we like CapRover for our development environments is its scalability. As your app grows, CapRover grows with you. It provides an easy way to scale your app, whether you're dealing with an increase in data, a surge in traffic, or expanding your app's features. This makes it a reliable platform for both small projects and large-scale applications.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

In the fast-paced world of app development, continuous integration and continuous deployment are essential for maintaining an efficient workflow. CapRover supports CI/CD, allowing you to frequently integrate changes and deploy updates to your app. This means you can ensure your app is always up-to-date and performing at its best.---


While CapRover is an excellent Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution with many benefits, like any other tool, it may not be the best fit for every scenario. Here are a few situations where you might want to consider alternatives to CapRover.

## Large-Scale Enterprise Use

CapRover is a fantastic solution for individual developers and small to medium-sized businesses. However, if you're operating at a large scale with a complex architecture, you might need a more robust solution. Larger PaaS providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure offer a more comprehensive suite of tools and services that can handle the complexities of large-scale enterprise use. Though for testing cases, Caprover can help you on that scaling part.

## Need for Advanced, Specialized Features

While CapRover supports a wide range of applications and offers several key features, there might be instances where you need advanced, specialized features that are unique to certain PaaS providers. For example, if you need specific AI/ML services, data analytics services, or unique integrations that are only offered by larger PaaS providers, CapRover might not be the best fit.

## Fully Managed Service Requirement

CapRover is a self-hosted solution, which gives you full control over your data and environment. However, this also means that you are responsible for managing and maintaining the server where CapRover is hosted. If you're looking for a fully managed service where things like server maintenance, security updates, and scaling are handled for you, you might want to consider a different PaaS solution.

## Strict Compliance Requirements

If your application needs to adhere to strict regulatory compliance requirements, such as HIPAA for healthcare or PCI DSS for finance, you may need to use a PaaS that offers dedicated compliance certifications and features. While CapRover's self-hosted nature gives you control over your data, it might be challenging to meet these compliance standards without the additional support provided by some larger PaaS providers.

## Important to note (as of the writing of this article)
While clustering in CapRover can provide a level of resiliency, it's not without its challenges. Here are a few points to consider:

1. Main Node Dependency: The SSL keys and configuration files reside on the main node. Therefore, if your main node goes down, these essential files will be unavailable, and your applications will stop working​1​. Having multiple nodes can provide resiliency in terms of worker nodes, but if you lose your main node, you'll be pretty much stuck. The only viable option in such a case would be to switch over to a new or backup server​.
2. Persistent Data Resiliency: This is currently beyond the scope of CapRover. It would require a significant amount of work to integrate with a storage cluster like Ceph or Gluster. This means that in a clustered environment, ensuring the availability and consistency of persistent data can be a challenge​1​.
3. Cloning Issues: Cloning a server may not always work as expected due to the way CapRover encrypts data using Docker swarm key. If you start a new swarm, your key might be different, rendering the cloned data inaccessible. The recommended approach is to take periodic backups of your CapRover instance​.

While CapRover offers a great PaaS solution, these points highlight why it might not be the best fit for all scenarios, particularly for complex, high-availability, and large-scale applications. Always remember to evaluate your specific needs and the characteristics of your applications when choosing a PaaS solution.
Have fun!
