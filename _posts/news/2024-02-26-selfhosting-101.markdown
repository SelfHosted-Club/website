If you've found your way to this post, you're probably curious about the ins and outs of self-hosting. Don't worry - you're in the right place. This is the starting line of your journey into the fantastic world of self-hosting. So buckle up, grab a cup of of coffee (or water if that's your thing), and let's dive in!

## What on Earth is Self-Hosting?

Great question! When we talk about 'self-hosting', we're talking about running and maintaining your own server to host services that you would typically rely on a third-party provider for. Think about services like email, file storage, or web hosting. Self-hosting is like being the captain of your own digital ship. You're in control of everything - from the data you store to the services you run and the software you install.
Self-hosting has been gaining traction in recent years as an attractive and cost-effective alternative to traditional hosting solutions. Whether you're running a blog, an e-commerce website, or any other type of online service, self-hosting gives you the flexibility to customize and control your hosting environment. 

One major appeal of self-hosting is the control it offers over your hosting environment. It provides the freedom to customize your setup, selecting the hardware, software, and services that meet your specific needs. Plus, you have the autonomy to make upgrades and improvements at your own pace.

To get started with self-hosting, you'll need both hardware and software. This includes a physical server or a cloud-based hosting solution, an operating system, a web server such as Apache or Nginx, and any additional software necessary to power your services. Depending on your requirements, you might also need other tools such as a database server or content management system.

I host majority of my cloud instances on [HostHatch] VPS (Virtual Private Server) Instance (In Asia) for a steal. Some of the other hosts I use are [RackNerd] (US) and [WebHorizon] (Asia+Europe) VPS, and decided that it is time to move away from Linode - which is a Great service, but I am looking to reduce the billing on instances. For comparison, I save more than 50% on HostHatch compared to [Linode] ($3.33 compared to $8) - Don't get me wrong, if this was an extremely critical application, I would keep it on [Linode].

## The Essential Considerations for a Smooth Journey

If you're pondering the idea of self-hosting, there are a few key things you need to consider. Let's dive into some of the most crucial aspects - cost, reliability, performance, and technical support.

First up is cost. Self-hosting can often be a more budget-friendly choice compared to other hosting solutions, but it's not without its expenses. When you're planning out your self-hosting journey, remember to take into account the cost of hardware, software, and other necessities like domain registration. It's a bit like planning a road trip - you need to consider everything from gas to snacks!

Reliability and uptime are the next stops on our list. With self-hosting, you've got the steering wheel, which means you're in charge of handling any speed bumps along the way. This includes ensuring your server isn't swamped with traffic and that it's secured against any rogue internet bandits. You'll also need to keep your system updated with any new patches that roll out, to avoid any unwanted outages or security issues.

Performance is another key aspect of your self-hosting journey. Depending on what services you're hosting, you'll need to make sure your server has the horsepower to handle the traffic and requests. Just like you might need to upgrade your car for a cross-country trip, you may need to boost your hardware resources to ensure optimal performance.

Last, but certainly not least, is technical support. When you're self-hosting, you're essentially your own mechanic. It's vital to have a good understanding of your support options, whether that's online forums, step-by-step tutorials, or professional support services. There's a wealth of resources out there, so make sure you're equipped to troubleshoot any issues that might pop up.

Embarking on a self-hosting journey can be an empowering way to take the reins of your hosting environment and gain direct access to the services and resources you need. But, just like any journey, preparation is key. By considering cost, reliability, performance, and technical support, you'll be ready to make a confident leap into the world of self-hosting.

## Are there any risks involved with self hosting?

When it comes to self-hosting, it is important to be aware of the potential risks that come with it. Self-hosting involves the direct management of servers and services, which can leave your data vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other malicious activities. If not properly monitored, a self-hosted environment can suffer from downtime or performance issues and can cause a TON of frustration! However, many of these risks can be minimized with the implementation of proper security measures and regular maintenance. It is also important to consider the cost of self-hosting when weighing the potential risks, as it may not be financially viable for some. 


## How much does self hosting cost?

Self-hosting is an economical option for those that want to host their own services. It is generally much cheaper than other hosting services, but the cost of self-hosting depends on the type of service you are hosting and the hardware and software you are using. The cost of running the hardware and software can range from a few cents to a few hundred dollars per month, depending on the size and complexity of the hosting environment. However, the cost of self-hosting can often be offset by the savings from not having to pay for hosting services from a third-party provider. Additionally, if you have a lot of IT knowledge or experience, you may be able to save money by setting up and managing the hosting environment yourself.

One thing I can say for sure... It is addicting and if you don't monitor your time or investment into it you will get sucked in!

## What support options are available for self hosting?
There is a big mix of support options here.

Depending on the type of services you’re hosting, you may need to rely on external providers for help with setup, configuration, and maintenance. If you’re using a cloud-based hosting solution, the provider may also offer support for certain tasks. If you purchase a license for an opensource software that you selfhost, that's probably your first go-to on issues relating to the software.

There are also many free resources you can refer to, first one would probably be the github pages of the service you are hosting. Reddit is also a great resource and the selfhosted community at [r/selfhosted] should be your friend. Another one can be the reddit page for the service you are looking at.
